A break down and analysis of Monsters for DnD 5e


Dungeons and Dragons has become more popular with modern audiences, with shows like: Critical Role, Dimention 20, Not Another DnD podcast, Legends of Avantris and so many others becoming mian stream, Dungeons and Dragons has become something that people love, and something that people can make money off of. Engagement is key for people who want to spend the money for the books, figurines, and other marchandisable options, as such one of the ways people are hooked are throuh encounters. Fighting enemies is one of the ways that engagement happends, and as such each enounter needs to be good, this is usually done through the 'Challenge Rating' 
For this particular data, I was curious to know if the size and the challenge rating of the monsters in Dungeons and Dragons 5e complemented one another in size and challenge. 
Meaning that the smaller the foe the less XP you are going to get for the encounter. Creating balanced and nuanced enoucnters is an essantial part in having fun in DnD and as such the 
enoucnters have to be balanced in a manner that feels rewarding, to enocurage players to come back 

Finding a monsters data file at Kaggle.com (see files in repository) I was able to download and look through the data to see if my hypothesis was correct. After finding the data, I had to clean and convert the data types into what I wanted.

I decided to make 'Size', 'HP', and 'Challenge Rating numeric'; 'Armor', 'Speed', 'Race + alignment' are all categorical. this way I can create the graphs I want to and analyze the data how I want. 
Creating graphs of the data that measured size and challenege rating, my thought was that the smaller the enemy, the less HP and threfore the less engagement people would have.

This graph would indicate that yes, there is less HP for the smaller sized monsters than there are for the larger ones.
